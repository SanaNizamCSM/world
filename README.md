Conference Name:
The 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering ICSE 2020
(6-11 July 2020).
Published:

Introduction:
As we know that conventional metjod of software development has been changed
with the latest method software development technique called is open-source
platform such as GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab. As compared with old technique of
software development with latest one as more transparent and very scalable.
Addition features also give us these open-source platforms that entire code of
software are disperse in whole team member which are presented in different part
of the world. These software is not only provide us the code management but also
give us many other features like collaboration, versioning, backup and restore
features also. In this research paper we built a platform that crawls the
infrastructure of GitHub, analysis entire contributions data and evalutes that data
and give us answer multiple research questions relevent to the software
development process.
Motivation Of The Paper:
GitHub has a very large repository of data and has multiple aspects are hidden in
different metrics so we initiate to further dig up that data with different our
creating tools(Data downloader, MongoDB, Contributions Analyzer and Quality
Analyzer) and find out the researchers question’s answers.
Research Methodology:
One could study the correlation between issues and GitHub stars/forks [5], explore
the effects of issue labeling on the time required to resolve them [11] , or even
determine with resolving issues as early as possible is beneficial for the project [6]
.
Results:
Basically the result of the paper gives us that produce more and more useful
metrics of the software development aspects and also give the answers of the
researcher’s questions. It also gives the message that we create more repositories
and covered more scenarios and languages to find out the more scenarios of the
hidden metrics of the GitHub platform data.

2. Capture the Feature Flag: Detecting Feature Flags in
Open-Source

Title:
Capture the Feature Flag: Detecting Feature Flags in Open-Source.
Authors:
Jens Meinicke (Carnegie Mellon University), Juan Hoyos (Universidad Nacional
de Colombia,Colombia), Bogdan Vasilescu (Carnegie Mellon University,United
States), Christian Kastner (Carnegie Mellon University,United States).
Conference Name:
The 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering ICSE 2020
(6-11 July 2020).
Published:
ICSE 2020.
Introduction:
Feature flags continously having important in software development but having
controversial in continous development and delivery. Technically, feature flags
apply conditionally on code path and decision depends on external configuration
mechanism. The practical study is very less on this topic. The open-source
software development wealth is very large but feature flags applies on opensource systems are very less. According to this work the feature flags divert from
custom development to commercial development. In this paper feature flags based
on textual analysis. Technique applied for GitHub public repositories. We study
with small quantity of data and increases with the time in future. In our practice the
small amount of flags can be effective as compared with the large amount of flags.
Finally the paper goals is to find out the ways to apply the feature flagging on a
open-source projects.
Motivation Of The Paper:
Feature flags are not worldwide applied on the different nature of the projects and
we do not know about the outcome results after applying the feature flagging so
our study motivational aspects are to apply different open-source projects and
mining software repository of future flags.
Research Methodology:
Feature flags are a topic frequently discussed by practitioners in blog posts and at
practitioner conferences [2, 3], provide an extensive overview of grey literature on
feature flags [7] . To the best of our knowledge, the only study on feature flags 
using mining software repository techniques is the analysis of feature flags in
Chromium, the open-source implementation behind Google Chrome [9, 10].
Results:
It is very difficult to identify that we are implement feature flags on entire
repositories, so we explain semi-automated process on limited dataset of 100 opensource feature flagging projects and also their individual flags and their lifecycle.
The research explain us faster flag clean up and also control pending confirmation
experimental methods. Also our dataset gives practitioners to qualitive studies in
future and also gives technical evidence-based guidelines for effective practices.

3. Threat modeling: from infancy to maturity
Summary:-
Title:
Threat modeling: from infancy to maturity.
Authors:
Koen Yskout (imec – DistriNet, KU Leuven), Thomas Heyman (Toreon), Dimitri
Van Landuyt (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven), Laurens Sion (imec – DistriNet,

(Katholieke Universiteit Leuven).
Conference Name:
The 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering ICSE 2020
(6-11 July 2020).
Published:
ICSE 2020.
Introduction:
The purpose of the threat modeling is to identify the risk flows, mitigate and
identify the security flows and also implementation of the entire process. Microsoft
is basically implement them past years in many industries and academics. The
paper showing that there is no practically implementation but just only practice
apply both on academic and industries. The thesis depends on the handshaking
between practitioners and researchers and also improvements in high level
research.
Motivation Of The Paper:
We studied many research paper related to the topic and find out that threat
modeling is only depends upon practically only but there is no research work on it
and we found that there is no relation between practitioners and researchers. And
also we studied the COBIT and CMMI models and inspired from those. Depending
on those two models we research further and proposed multi-levels for threat
modeling.
Research Methodology:
Threat modeling is very typical research work so we starting from sketching the
entire process modeling as practiced by earlier Toreon. Research focus on 
academic literature because it is very less practical implemented in this field.
According to our goal set we having many challenges to accomplish it.
Results:
After throughly research work we proposed five levels of threat modeling.
Currently available model is initial level 1 model and has no standardized process
model. To develop a reference model and implementation academic for
benchmaking. Every process has evolve another process and built upon another
process. The created process is also well-defined manner. Also results of the
proposed model being correct and practically measurable. Entire process are
optimized and if we put their feedback process then it qualify the quality assurance
process. Because sketched research work is very challenging process so it will take
time to practically implementation in maturity level and also practically
engineering descipline.
